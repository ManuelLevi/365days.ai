# Emergency Fund

Set aside a sufficient amount in a separate account to cover three to six months' worth of living expenses. This financial cushion will provide peace of mind and protect you from unexpected financial setbacks.

Some banks provide a "rounding up" scheme where the expenses on your cards will be rounded up up to a certain level. Most people think they need all money they earn, however, if you round up your transactions, you will most likely  not feel a difference, but this change will accumulate.

Once you have reached your target, consider moving the money to a interest paying account, but make sure you're protected: this account should be garanteed by the central bank or similar authority and it should never be affected by market conditions.
