# Automatic Investments - Passive Income

Invest in income-generating assets, such as dividend-paying stocks, rental properties, or peer-to-peer lending platforms, to secure a steady passive income source that continues to grow over time.

## Divident-paying stocks

The most simple and maintenance free of all. Instead of running your own operations, you buy a piece of a companies that has employees that work for you.

## Rental properties

Might seems like a good idea, but remember that this won't be a one time thing, far from it.

You'll have to manage teenants, maintain the properties, etc.

## Peer-to-peer lending

This can be very risky at there is a risk of default. In most cases, it won't be passive either as you might have to select the people you want to lend your money too.
